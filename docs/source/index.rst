DepthAI SDK is a Python package, containing convenience classes and functions that help in most common tasks while using DepthAI API.
It is created on top of the regular DepthAI API.
The package was created to make your use of DepthAI easier. It consists of managers, which handle different aspects of development:

.. include::  modules-list.rst

Before we take a look at how to use DepthAI SDK, we first have to install it.

Installation
------------
.. include::  install.rst

To help you understand and learn how the package works, we created a few simple tutorials, which will teach you how to use our manager.
We prepared the following tutorials:

- :ref:`Pipeline manager`
- :ref:`Preview manager`
- :ref:`Encoding manager`
- :ref:`Blob manager`
- :ref:`Nnet manager`

We recommend that you start with the :ref:`Pipeline manager`
